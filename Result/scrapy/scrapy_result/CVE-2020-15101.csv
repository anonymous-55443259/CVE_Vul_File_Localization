Nested directory structure can interrupt scan

Package:

No package listed
Affected versions
<=0.1.0
Patched versions
0.1.1

Description:
Impact
A directory structure of more than 1000 nested directories can interrupt a freewvs scan due to Python's recursion limit and os.walk(). This can be problematic in a case where an administrator scans the dirs of potentially untrusted users.
Patches
This has been fixed in this commit by limiting the recursion to 500 directories:
