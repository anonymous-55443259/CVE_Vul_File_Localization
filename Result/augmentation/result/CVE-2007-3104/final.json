Local\nattackers could manipulate ioctls and cause kernel memory consumption\nleading to a denial of service. (CVE-2007-2525)\nAn integer underflow was discovered in the cpuset filesystem.  If mounted,\nlocal attackers could obtain kernel memory using large file offsets while\nreading the tasks file. This could disclose sensitive data. (CVE-2007-2875)\nVilmos Nebehaj discovered that the SCTP netfilter code did not correctly\nvalidate certain states.  A remote attacker could send a specially crafted\npacket causing a denial of service. (CVE-2007-2876)\nLuca Tettamanti discovered a flaw in the VFAT compat ioctls on 64-bit\nsystems.  A local attacker could corrupt a kernel_dirent struct and cause\na denial of service. (CVE-2007-2878)\nA flaw in the sysfs_readdir function allowed a local user to cause a\ndenial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer. (CVE-2007-3104)\nA buffer overflow was discovered in the random number generator.  In\nenvironments with granular assignment of root privileges, a local attacker\ncould gain additional privileges. (CVE-2007-3105)\nA flaw was discovered in the usblcd driver.  A local attacker could cause\nlarge amounts of kernel memory consumption, leading to a denial of service.\n(CVE-2007-3513)\nZhongling Wen discovered that the h323 conntrack handler did not correctly\nhandle certain bitfields.  A remote attacker could send a specially crafted\npacket and cause a denial of service. (CVE-2007-3642)\nA flaw was discovered in the CIFS mount security checking.  Remote attackers\ncould spoof CIFS network traffic, which could lead a client to trust the\nconnection. (CVE-2007-3843)\nIt was discovered that certain setuid-root processes did not correctly\nreset process death signal handlers.  A local user could manipulate this\nto send signals to processes they would not normally have access to.\n(CVE-2007-3848)\nThe Direct Rendering Manager for the i915 driver could be made to write\nto arbitrary memory locations.  An attacker with access to a running X11\nsession could send a specially crafted buffer and gain root privileges.\n(CVE-2007-3851)\nIt was discovered that the aacraid SCSI driver did not correctly check\npermissions on certain ioctls.  A local attacker could cause a denial\nof service or gain privileges.

Avaya System Products with kernel installed:\nProduct:\nAffected Version(s):\nRisk Level:\nActions:\nAvaya Communication Manager\nCM 3.1 and CM 4.x\nLow\nUpgrade to CM 5.0 or later.\nAvaya Messaging Storage Server\nMSS 3.x\nLow\nUpgrade to MSS 4.0 or later.\nAvaya Message Networking\nAll\nLow\nSee recommended actions below.\u00a0\u00a0This issue will be\naddressed in\naccordance with\nAvaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy\nAvaya CCS/SES\nSES 3.1.1 or newer\nLow\nUpgrade to SES 5.0 or later.\nAvaya AES\nAES 4.x\nLow\nUpgrade to AES 4.2 or later.\nRecommended Actions:For all system products which use\nvulnerable\nversions of the kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local\nand network access to the server.  This restriction should be\nenforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,\nVPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such\ntime as an update becomes available and can be installed.\n3. Avaya Software-Only Products:\nAvaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating\nsystems.\nOccasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying\noperating\nsystem or applications that come with the operating system. These\nvulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly\nbut may\nthreaten the integrity of the underlying platform.\nIn the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not\naffected\nby the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.\nCustomers should determine on which Linux operating system the product\nwas\ninstalled and then follow that vendor's guidance.\n4. Software-Only Products:\nProduct:\nActions:\nCVLAN\nDepending on the Operating System provided by customers, the\naffected\npackage may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting\nthe CVLAN\napplication. The CVLAN application does not require the software\ndescribed in\nthis advisory.\nAvaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS)\nDepending on the Operating System provided by customers, the\naffected\npackage may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting\nthe IMS\napplication. The IMS application does not require the software described\nin this\nadvisory.\nRecommended Actions:In the event that the affected package\nis\ninstalled, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions\nsupplied\nby RedHat Linux.\n5.

This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2007-3104, specifically impacts the `sysfs_readdir` function, enabling a local user to trigger a system crash. The flaw is due to improper handling of null pointer dereference, which can be exploited by a local attacker to cause a denial of service condition. This issue has been addressed in various Linux distributions including Ubuntu, where updates to the kernel packages have been made available to mitigate this vulnerability. Users are advised to update their systems to the patched versions to prevent potential exploits by local attackers aiming to disrupt system operations."}]
