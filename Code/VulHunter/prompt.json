You will be given a CVE vulnerability description and a list of repository files organized in a tree structure, and your task is to find the file where the vulnerability occurs. A vulnerability is usually only related to a few files, and you need to find the exact file where the vulnerability occurs. You can view the file content to determine whether it is a vulnerability file. Output a Python-formatted list of file names associated with the vulnerability. Note that only the file list is output, without any prompt information."
